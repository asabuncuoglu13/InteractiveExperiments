## Interactive Experiments
#### Interactive Learning Environment with Physics Simulations.

Interactive Experiment is an application prototype for mobile learning environment. This app combines three main components:

1. Chat Bot as a teaching assistant and navigation panel. It answers the questions about topics covered by the app. Besides, if the user asks, it directs to another activity 
2. Physics simulations to see the effect of parameter change in experiments such as “Inclined Plane Experiment” and “Speed and Acceleration Test”. 
3. Coding module that enables programming the experiment with simple blocks. With including programming, we aimed to integrate coding to other lessons. In this paper, we discuss the design process of the application, interaction of students with this app and possible future directions.
