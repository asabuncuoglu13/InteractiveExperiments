                    <h3>Theory and Design Behind Interactive Experiments</h3>
                    <p>
                        Creating educational apps with theories of learning enhances the impact of using these apps. Pasek et al. suggests building
                        educational apps with the four pillars of learning -active, engaging, meaningful and socially interactive
                        learning- increases effectiveness. [1]. The four pillars of this learner-centric structure can be
                        summarized as: (1) Active learning to encourage showing mental effort on practices. (2) Engaged learning
                        to keep learners concentrated on the current activity. (3) Meaningful learning to build a deeper
                        understanding by combining different subjects. (4) Socially interactive learning to support the discussions
                        between learners to analyze different perspectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although using technology eases the implementation of these learning theories to educational apps, Buckingham argues that
                        technology makes only a minor contribution to current educational tools [2]. Lack of technologically
                        enhanced educational applications directed us to create a learning environment which attracts the
                        attention directly to the teaching object, support new inquiry techniques and engage students with
                        minds-on activities. We have designed this environment as a smartphone application to access to great
                        variety of learners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To that end, our learning environment, “Interactive Experiments”, is created to enhance the engagement of students and support
                        diverse groups in a single application. The application includes three inter-related components -Chat
                        Module, Physics Simulations Module, Programming Module- to construct the four pillars of learning:
                        (1) Minds on learning means creating different perspectives by showing mental effort on activities.
                        We aimed to increase this effort with setting the physics simulation parameters with using code blocks
                        and sensors (e.g. tilting phone to set the angle of inclined plane). (2) Engaged learning builds
                        a continuous interaction through the interface to increase the attention and the amount of learned
                        material. We put navigation option and teaching assistance to Chat Module to keep the learner’s attention
                        on to subject and build a continuous flow. (3) Meaningful learning promotes creating and testing
                        hypothesis. We served an easy-to-use environment to manipulate experimental variables to test hypothesis
                        and grasp the conceptual model behind the experiments. (4) Socially interactive environment supports
                        discussions in classroom to understand the newly encountered material. We enabled the classroom-chat
                        in the Chat Module to keep the classroom connected.
